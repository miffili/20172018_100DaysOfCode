## Round 3 | Daily Log

_Wanna start at D1? [Go ahead](#d1-100daysofcode--apr232018)_

### **D5 #100DaysOfCode // May262018**

**miscellaneous**

* tinkered a lot with the HTML `<canvas>`-tag
  * coded a hexagon out of triangles
  * coded a little Android symbol

**thoughts**
The refactoring for my clients involves changing the game characters in different logos. Because it's the weekend & I don't know, if it would be sufficient to just implement images in the canvas element or to rather code the symbols, I decided to do it in my freetime. It's a lot like p5.js, which gives me an advantage because I've already spent that much time working on my illustrations.. (And holy moly is the B.A. Baracus of the A-Team detailed..) 😅  
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do the Apple logo, which is a bit more difficult, but putting the image as a background & layering the illustration on top, makes for a rather quick process.  
If I find time, I will also translate it, so that all coordinated origin from the center of the canvas element. 😊  
But for now it's bedtime.

_May252018_

I won't count today, but I still wanted to log, what happened.

Yesterday morning, I met with two web developers in Rostock, one of them I've known loosely for more than 10 years. We talked a bit about what they needed from a frontend developer & about what I've already done. And agreed, that I would work for them on a freelance basis & they would let me know, when they'd have something for me.

Well, today already came the call. And I have a fun little project. It's vanilla JS/HTML canvas & super fun.

So today I worked on that assignment for _4hs_. It is in fact coding. But since I cannot really log, what I do as paid gigs, I will not count it in my official logs.

But! It's a nice achievement to get paid to code. 😊 And that's definitely notable. (I'll wait for the official announcement once I got paid the first time though.😇)

### **D4 #100DaysOfCode // May242018**

**miscellaneous**

* checked one point of my Explore JS list
  * browsed a bit through the [MDN web docs: WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
  * watched [The Coding Train's WebGL in p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiKWXUX-o8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bPhi8sS1hHJ77n3zRO9FR_) playlist

**thoughts**
So.. I had some adulting to do in the morning. And a migraine struck in the afternoon (= loooooong nap 😴). After those kinds of days, there isn't that much happening, so I just read a bit in the MDN docs on a topic that's on my list for a while & watched the better part of the WebGL in p5.js playlist of The Coding Train.

### **D3 #100DaysOfCode // May232018**

**miscellaneous**

* read about HTML `<meta>`-tags
* checked out Facebook's Open Graph protocol http://ogp.me/
* checked out the [Twitter dev docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started.html) for Twitter cards
* updated portfolio a little
* started to implement ogp data in portfolio
* fought again with LinkedIn 😒, it won
* updated some code in chuckyN & the weather app (one fetch error due to http/https & a missing parameter).

**thoughts**
Today was a awkward day, not really bad more on the confusing side of things. Maybe because of tomorrow's meeting. However, I worked on bits & pieces which would otherwise just rot on my to do list forever. 😅 I think, I will make this a weekly habit, just jot down all of those rather tiny tasks & dedicate half a day to get those things done & stay up to date.  
Fixing a mistake in an old app showed me, that I've come a long way. I still like my code & could read it rather good. But I also saw a lot of things, I would not do anymore & I had the urge to refactor the code. But I kept it as it is, because I think it is a nice way to see, how I develop as a developer. And the freeCodeCamp projects are still snapshots of my level of knowledge at that time. 😇

### **D2 #100DaysOfCode // May222018**

**coding**

* Note Application
  * named app "SMPLnote"
  * added editor & editor tasks
    * update change for note title & text
  * stored state data in `localStorage` of browser
  * added function to delete note
  * pushed project to github & deployed project

» https://Miffili.github.io/smpl_note/

**thoughts**
Everything works, nothing works, everything works again, no that doesn't work. 😅 That sums pretty much up, how it was to work on the React note app. But I got it working except the list issue which is described in the README.md. I have to look at this at some point, checking where the mistake occurs. It's not a fatal error though. Lists just don't get saved in the simpleMDE. But enough for today. 😇

### **D1 #100DaysOfCode // May212018**

**coding**

* Note Application
  * start with the course material
  * added sidebar & sidebar tasks
    * add note
    * provide style for current note
    * show current note in editor

**thoughts**
After my break, it feels really good to code again. Although, I have to admit, that I'm having my issues with focusing on one task at hand. I guess it's back to the good old pen&paper method, writing all thoughts down first & then work on the tasks – one by one. 😊

_May112018 – May202018_

Because I was in a rather bad place mentally, I allowed myself to take a thorough break. At some point, I just wrote the same goals/tasks for the day over & over again, without really accomplishing something. It all just felt like a big blur.
After taking more than 2 days off, I restart the 3rd round, but will keep the progress so far in this log.

### **D14 #100DaysOfCode // May102018**

**coding**

* Scribble | LinkedParticles
  * sketched idea on paper
  * started coding

**thoughts**
Admittedly, coding lately was more of a burden than something enjoyable for me. Not the act of coding itself, but choosing on what topics to concentrate. Do I learn a framework? Or another one? Am I learning the right one? How do I learn it in the most effective & maybe the fastest way? Should I already learn another language? How do I compensate the lack of an engineering degree? How do I earn money?
Working with p5 again after such a long time.. and working on something purely for fun, was such a nice change. There are so many things, that are really important in the real world. But for me to keep being motivated & perform on a high level, I need to just do useless stuff from time to time. After all, I have to admit, that the projects I'm most proud of are the ones, I was totally enthusiastic about – the Bubble Machine & the redesigned Simon game. 😊 It's like [Simone Giertz said in her TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY), doing useless things helps overcoming performance anxiety. It's just about fun, not only for oneself, but also for others. 😇 Probably back to schedule tomorrow.

### **D13 #100DaysOfCode // May082018**

**other**

* read about software testing
  * types of software testing (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
  * read through a tutorial of test driven development in JavaScript
  * checked out different tools for testing in JavaScript (jest, mocha, jasmine)

**thoughts**
Unfortunately, I didn't feel that well today & had a hard time focusing. So I decided to check something off my to do list: software testing in JavaScript. 🙂 I think I will incorporate it in future projects, just to get the hang of it & get comfortable using different tools for testing. 😊

* Advanced CSS & Sass | How CSS Works
  * converting px to `rem`
  * how CSS renders a website (the visual formatting model)
  * CSS architecture, components & BEM
  * implemented BEM in Natours project

**thoughts**
MELLOW MONDAY! 😄 I love the fact that Mondays are my Sundays. 🙂 I get to recap the prior week, plan out the week ahead & just relax. Nonetheless I finished the How it Works chapter today. And revisited the notes I took so far of CSS concepts.

### **D11 #100DaysOfCode // May062018**

**resources**

* JavaScript & React for Developers
  * learned about yarn, Grunt & Gulp (definitely need to check that out more)
  * revisited what React is
  * revisited Component Lifecycle Methods
  * revisited state & properties
  * learned about presentational & container components

**coding**

* Get Yo Cook On
  * sketched out modal layout
  * added ingredients & preparation data to recipes.js
  * added modal with recipe details

**thoughts**
Sometimes, I think I wouldn't do enough, especially on days I shift my 'work time' after lunch and take the morning off. But then again, I still have to prepare everything for an eventual move in the future, so I'm not not working.
I'm super happy with the progress today. Especially the Get Yo Cook On is getting along nicely, if I say so myself. 😇 I get the hang of working in steps & working with an external library, in this case reactstrap, for the styling. I know, this part would take me too many hours otherwise.

### **D10 #100DaysOfCode // May052018**

**coding**

* Get Yo Cook On
  * added recipe collection in separate file
  * added state to App
  * hooked RecipeCard up with data via props
  * experimented with different layout additions
  * added type checking to RecipeCard & Landing
  * deployed project

**thoughts**
As it was a fairly warm day today, I enjoyed the weather. 😇 But I managed to update the RecipeCard as I intended to do. Slowly I get in the flow of checking reactstrap for possible components as well as cross reference them with Bootstrap v4 itself. I really like the Card component it makes a lot super simple.
Plus: the React docs are thorough & simultaneously to the point.

### **D9 #100DaysOfCode // May042018**

**coding**

* Get Yo Cook On
  * deleted Nav due to redesign
  * switched from react-bootstrap to reactstrap
  * updated all affected components
  * tinkered a bit with the Bootstrap v4 Card component

**other**

* learned how to add a commit message using the built in vim editor 😇

**thoughts**
Because I drank a red bull for dinner, I immediately started D9 at midnight. 😅 Solid 2 hours of coding and I'm glad, I did it at night. Nothing there to distract me in any kind. The switch was fairly smooth.
I revisited how to delete a npm package.
Then I slept until noon and my whole day was totally wacked. 😄 Went to bed early to be fresh in the morning.

  * [Where is my parent!?(cry)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58539230879867a8cd00011c)

**thoughts**
Well today was immediately off on the wrong foot. I slept in, then talked to my brother for over an hour. Had to collect my thoughts afterwards.. Then scalded three of my right hand's fingers while making lunch and had to cool them for over three hours, hence the lack of coding today. But after midnight, I'm gonna start D9. 😋

### **D7 #100DaysOfCode // May022018**

**resources**

* Advanced CSS & Sass | Natours Project Part I
  * `clip-path`
  * animations with `@keyframes`
  * `animation-fill-mode`
* Advanced CSS & Sass | How CSS Works: A look behind the scenes

  * the three pillars of good HTML & CSS

**other**

* installed different packages for atom
  * pigment
  * minimap
  * color-picker
* installed chrome extension that displays .md-files in GitHub-style for preview

**thoughts**
Today was a CSS kinda day. 😊 I started with the Advanced CSS & Sass course and all starts to make sense now. But I still am more a fan of JavaScript, who shouts at you in different variants when something isn't working. With CSS, you often times don't even know, **what** is not working let alone **why**. And if not earlier, today it was obvious that I'm becoming a nerd – being happy about installing different packages in ATOM & still being stoked about my windows emoticon picker. 😇 I slowly understand the saying "developers are lazy". 😄

### **D6 #100DaysOfCode // May012018**

**resources**

* JavaScript & React for Developers
  * refreshed concepts of the DOM, events & callbacks, AJAX, JSON as well as scope of variables, in particular of `this`
  * refreshed concepts of ES6+ (var types, default values, destructing, literals, arrow functions)

**coding**

* codewars
  * [Decipher this!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/581e014b55f2c52bb00000f8/train/javascript)

**other**

* Get Yo' Cook On
  * redesigned whole application
  * sketched out user stories
  * decided to use reactstrap (based on bootstrap v4) instead of react-bootstrap

**thoughts**
I'm back. 😄 After some necessary off days, I started slowly today. At the moment, the most exhausting part of coding is the thought of needing to get a job, because I'm running out of savings. And I'm struggling to decide whether I should already apply for coding jobs, and if so where or if I just try to find a non related job in this area & build up a savings cushion again. Or at least support myself. 🙊

_Apr282018 – Apr302018_

Had to take three days off, because I needed to focus on my mental health. Will be back tomorrow. ♥

### **D5 #100DaysOfCode // Apr272018**

**resources**

* started CS50x on Week 0
  * introduction to the course
  * introduction to how computers work
    * binary, ASCII, Unicode
    * input -» [Algorithm] -» output
    * computational thinking
  * introduction to Scratch

**other**

* woke up to a few warnings on all of my create-react-app applications hosted on GitHub
* researched a bit, tested out fixes on the test-react repo
* learned, that it wasn't a critical bug & a false alarm whatsoever
* also learned about package.json as well as package-lock.json files

**thoughts**
Oh, how I wished I had courses like that in my university time! Today I realized, how fun it can be to be self taught, to be free in the choices of courses & not bound to a certain syllabus. I get to choose with whom I learn, and get to put together a plan, that is both fun & educational.  
The warning on GitHub was a nice learning scenario, not only in keeping calm, but also in researching, reaching out to experienced developers & learning to comb through information.

### **D3 #100DaysOfCode // Apr252018**

**coding**

* Website
  * added Get Yo' Cook On to portfolio section
  * fixed stickey nav, so that it tucks itself on the top nice & smooth
  * added smooth scroll via third party script
  * updated the image sizes, unfortunately the background image is still a bit slow in loading
  * finished logo & added it to nav bar & as favicon
  * merged relaunch branch with master, pushed to GitHub, officially relaunched 🚀

**thoughts**
Today I launched the redesign of my website. It'll remain a work in progress as I got a lot more ideas for it. But for now, I'm pretty happy with it. (Although I always think, I'm designing for giants. The font-sizes are always pretty big. 😇)  
To be honest, I'm kinda sad, because on an instance today, but it'll be all good again tomorrow.

### **D2 #100DaysOfCode // Apr242018**

**coding**

* Website
  * added about section including connect possibilities
* Get Yo' Cook On
  * cleaned up current code
  * added responsiveness
  * added navigation

**thoughts**

Today I made some progress with my relaunch of the website, the basic styling & structure is done. It is, for the moment a MVP to launch & get going. So after the launch, I will continue to work on the website and maybe feed it some more content. 😊  
Working on the Get Yo' Cook On React app, I have to admit, that individual styling with React-Bootstrap is a bit wonky. I may change the styling to match default styles of Bootstrap, e.g. a horizontal navbar at the top of the page rather than a vertical one, as I would like it. We'll see. 🙂

### **D1 #100DaysOfCode // Apr232018**

**coding**

* Website
  * tried to implement smoother transition of mobile menu opening/closing
  * tried to implement fancy hover effect for non mobile menu links
  * feed portfolio

**other**

* installed atom-prettier & familiarized with tool

**thoughts**

After struggling with different advanced CSS effects , I'm definitely putting this CSS course on my list for R3. 😇 But all in all, I really like how the redesign comes along. It's much more sophisticated & job hunt ready. And deciding to code a real nice mvp first, was a good call for my sanity. 😄  
I can't wait to start a much more focused round & to continue with this journey.
